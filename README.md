## ðŸ§  Settlement Calculation Logic

1. **Balance Calculation**  
   Total paid - Fair share = Net balance

2. **Creditor/Debtor Separation**  
   Split people into those who are owed and those who owe

3. **Settlement Optimization**  
   Use greedy matching to minimize number of payments needed

### Example

- Shantanu: Paid â‚¹1100, Owes â‚¹710 â†’ Balance: +â‚¹390  
- Sanket: Paid â‚¹730, Owes â‚¹710 â†’ Balance: +â‚¹20  
- Om: Paid â‚¹300, Owes â‚¹710 â†’ Balance: -â‚¹410  

ðŸ‘‰ Optimized Settlement:  
Om pays â‚¹390 to Shantanu and â‚¹20 to Sanket
